== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* OADP currently does not support backup and restore of AWS EFS volumes using restic in Velero (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-778[*OADP-778*]).

* CSI backups might fail due to a Ceph limitation of 100 `VolumeSnapshotContent` snapshots per PVC
+
You can create many snapshots of the same persistent volume claim (PVC) but cannot schedule periodic creation of snapshots.
+
** For CephFS, you can create up to 100 snapshots per PVC.
** For RADOS Block Device (RBD), you can create up to 512 snapshots per PVC. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-804[*OADP-804*]) and (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-975[*OADP-975*])
