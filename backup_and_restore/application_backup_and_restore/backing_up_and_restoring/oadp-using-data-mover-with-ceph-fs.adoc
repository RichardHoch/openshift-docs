= Using Data Mover for CSI snapshots with Ceph FS storage

You can use Snapshot-backed volumes allow CephFS subvolume snapshots to be exposed as regular read-only PVCs. No data cloning is performed and provisioning such volumes is done in constant time.

Prerequisites
Prerequisites for this feature are the same as for creating PVCs with snapshot volume source. See Create snapshot and Clone Volume for more information.

Usage
Provisioning a snapshot-backed volume from a volume snapshot
For provisioning new snapshot-backed volumes, following configuration must be set for storage class(es) and their PVCs respectively:

StorageClass:
Specify backingSnapshot: "true" parameter.
PersistentVolumeClaim:
Set storageClassName to point to your storage class with backing snapshots enabled.
Define spec.dataSource for your desired source volume snapshot.
Set spec.accessModes to ReadOnlyMany. This is the only access mode that is supported by this feature.
Mounting snapshots from pre-provisioned volumes
Steps for defining a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for pre-provisioned CephFS subvolumes are identical to those described in Static PVC with ceph-csi, except one additional parameter must be specified: backingSnapshotID. CephFS-CSI driver will retrieve the snapshot identified by the given ID from within the specified subvolume, and expose it to workloads in read-only mode. Volume access mode must be set to ReadOnlyMany.

Note that the snapshot retrieval is done by traversing <rootPath>/.snap and searching for a directory that contains backingSnapshotID value in its name. The specified snapshot ID does not necessarily need to be the complete directory name inside <rootPath>/.snap, however it must be complete enough to uniquely identify that directory.

Example:

$ ls .snap
_f279df14-6729-4342-b82f-166f45204233_1099511628283
_a364870e-6729-4342-b82f-166f45204233_1099635085072
f279df14-6729-4342-b82f-166f45204233 would be considered a valid value for backingSnapshotID volume parameter, whereas 6729-4342-b82f-166f45204233 would not, as it would be ambiguous.

If the given snapshot ID is ambiguous, or no such snapshot is found, mounting the PVC will fail with INVALID_ARGUMENT error code.
